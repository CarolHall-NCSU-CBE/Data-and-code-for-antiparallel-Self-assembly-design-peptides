=======================
1. File types
=======================
REQUIRED INPUT FILES:
comp.pdb                   - contains the PDB file of the intitial backbone scaffold of reference peptide
input.txt                  - contains the input parameters required to start the design 

OUTPUT FILES:
/pdbfiles/*.pdb            - output PDB files of PepAD generated peptide sequences will be stores in the pdbfiles folder
energydetails.txt          - 
energyprofile.txt-         
minimum_energy.txt 



=======================================================================
3. "input.in" file 
WARNING: Keep all labels in the input.in file, 
DO NOT change/add/delete labels in input.in file. 
For example, leave the "Pressure [bar]" label even if the 
ensemble is not NPT, the MC program will automatically skip this label.
Variables required under each label are explained.
=======================================================================
Ensemble
    'NVT' - canonical ensemble
    'NPT' - isobaric-isothermal ensemble (current version only allows cubic box and there is no external structure in the box)
    'uVT' - grand canonical ensemble

Temperature [K]
    temp - Temperature of the system.
            Double precision.

Pressure [bar]
    press - Pressure of the system, only effective when
            ensemble is "NPT". Double precision.

Number of Boxes
    n_box - In the current verison (v1.7), only one box is needed.
            I haven't coded two box version for Gibbs ensemble yet.
            Integer.

Number of Molecule Types
    n_mol_types - Integer.

Maximum Number of Sites on the Molecule
    n_sites_max - Integer.

Number of Nonbonded Types
    n_nonbond_types - Number of nonbonded interaction site types. 
                      Used for cross check with mol.in file. Integer.

Chemical Potential [K]
    mu(molecule type 1) mu(molecule type 2) ...
                    - Only effective when "uVT" ensemble. Double precision.

Number of Molecules
    n_mol(molecule type 1) n_mol(molecule type 2)...
                    - Number of molecules for each molecule type. Integer.

Potential Form
    'Lennard-Jones' - 12-6 LJ nonbonded interactions, only this format
                    has been coded for now.

Mixing Rules
    'Lorentz-Berthelot' - The cross-interaction term will be 
                          automatically calculated.
    'Explicit'          - Cross-interaction parameters should be 
                          explicitly listed in mol.in file. I wrote this 
                          for my conformal sites model project, especially for 
                          Coulombic interactions.
