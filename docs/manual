1. File types
=======================
REQUIRED INPUT FILES:
comp.pdb                   - contains the PDB file of the intitial backbone scaffold of reference peptide
input.txt                  - contains the input parameters required to start the design 

OUTPUT FILES:
/pdbfiles/*.pdb            - output PDB files of PepAD generated peptide sequences will be stores in the pdbfiles folder
energydetails.txt          - output file storing information of every attempt at each step and its corresponding peptide sequence; score; binding free energy component
                           of score; entropy component of score; hydrophobicity component of the intrinsic aggregation propensity term,; the sum of alpha-helical propensity, 
                           beta-sheet propensity, net charge and sequence pattern componenent of the intrinsic aggregation propensity term; and whether an exchange move or 
                           mutation move was performed.
energyprofile.txt          - output file storing information of the last attempt at each step and its corresponding score; binding free energy component
                           of score; entropy component of score; hydrophobicity component of the intrinsic aggregation propensity term,; the sum of alpha-helical propensity, 
                           beta-sheet propensity, net charge and sequence pattern componenent of the intrinsic aggregation propensity term
minimum_energy.txt        - output file storing step number, attempt number, and score everytime the design algorithm reaches a new global minima in its score

3. "input.in" file
=======================================================================
  filename (comp.pdb)      recalcu_switch (Equal to 0 if starting from initial PDB file, and equal to 1 if starting from another file)
  
  nstep_start (the starting step number)    nstep_terminal (the final step number)
  
  idum (seed for the ranmdom number)         ekt (a value determined empirically for each project, controls the likelihood of sequence change moves being accepted)
  
  fpho (no. of hydrophobic residues)  fpol (no. of polar residues)   fchg (no. of charged residues)   foth (no. of other residues)
  
  num4category (i=1 to n, sheetnumber for beta-sheet type structure)
  
  peptideID (i=1 to n, peptide ID for each peptide on sheet i)
