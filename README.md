# Data and Code for antiparallel self-assembly design peptides
This repository contains the data and codes associated with the paper-Sequence Patterns and Signatures: Computational and Experimental Discovery of Amyloid forming peptides, submitted to PNAS Nexus.


# Requirement and Installation
The source codes are in /code/. Compiler such as gfortran or ifort is required

# Getting Started
/code/-This directory contains the following files and directories:
1. main.f90-source code
2. /lib/-This directory contains the forcefield and rotamer parameters of all the 20 natural amino acids
3. comp.pdb-An example of the input PDB file needed to start the design
4. input.txt-Input file to start design
5. pdbfiles-This is an empty directory where the pdbfiles will be stored of the new peptides that are designed
